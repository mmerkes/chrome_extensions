#Patriotize it!

Do you ever just get fed up with politics? If so, Patriotize it! may just be the useless Chrome extension for you. The basic concept is that if you go to the websites of your least favorite politicians, Patriotize it! will go through the website and convert a lot of the partisan language to comical nonsense. The more partisan, the better.

###DISCLAIMER: 

This is not a political statement. Patriotize it! is meant to make both sides of the US mainstream aisle look comical. If you have particular attachment to a well known political figure on either side, I would avoid 'Conservatizing' or 'Liberalizing' the webpage involving them. The changes are meant to be comical, though some may find some of the changes offensive, particularly since the method of changes the words is more hammer than finesse. The results will definitely be unpredictable...

If you're still interested, clone the repo and go to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome, click 'Developer Mode', and click 'Load unpacked extension...'. Add the entire folder, and you should be set. Visit your favorite or least favorite political figures!

It shoud look like this:

`Conservatize it!` to alter liberal figures, and `Liberalize it!` to alter conservative figures.
